# Bootstrap-Portfolio-C3

## Description

This repository serves to showcase my work in completing the Module 3 Challenge of my edX Bootcamp. 

The challenge was to re-create my portfolio site, from the Module 2 Challenge - https://aireytf.github.io/Week2-Challenge-Portfolio/

The original portfolio was guided by the Demo provided in the following screenshots:

![Demo2](/images/Screenshot2.png)

The further version of my portfolio, for this challenge, was required to feature the following:

A Navigation bar:
- A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.
- Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
- Links should navigate to the appropriate sections

A hero section:
- A jumbotron featuring my picture, my name, and any other info.

A work section:
- A section displaying my work in grid.
- Use bootstrap cards for each project.
The description should give a brief overview of the work.
Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

A skills section
-List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

An about / contact section.
-An "About Me" section in the same row.

A footer section.
-All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
-All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.


I have, also, included a CV section in my header (though this was beyond the minimum required features for this challenge). I will include a link to my CV, as I update this portfolio overtime.
